## Strava Training Load & Performance Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes personal Strava running data to explore relationships
between training volume, intensity, and performance over time. The goal is to
demonstrate how athlete-generated data can be used to support training
optimization and long-term health awareness.

This project uses personal Strava data to provide an overall analysis of training intensity, volume, and 
performance over time. This is geard to show how athelte/health related data can be used to support training
optimization and long term health, as well as show the importance of having access to this kind of data.


### Data
- Source: Personal Strava activity export
- Metrics: distance, duration, pace, elevation, and activity dates
- Raw data not included for data privacy reasons

### Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Metric generation including weekly mileage and rolling averages
- Trend analysis of training load and performance metrics
- Interactive visualization built using Streamlit

### Key Insights
- Training volume trends show clear periods of progression and consolidation
- Rolling averages help contextualize short-term performance fluctuations
- Visualizing workload over time highlights potential overtraining risk periods

### Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Streamlit
- Data visualization

### Next Steps
- Incorporate heart rate or recovery metrics
- Extend analysis to injury risk or fatigue modeling
- Compare multiple training blocks for performance outcomes
